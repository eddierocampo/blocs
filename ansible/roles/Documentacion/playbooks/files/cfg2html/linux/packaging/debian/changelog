  [ Ralph Roth ]
  * 6.13 upstream
  * debian/compat
    This file should contain the number 9. This is a magic number. Do not put any other number in there.
    debian/compat specifies the "compatibility level" for the debhelper tool. We don't need to go into what that means, right now.
  * This is 6.26 upstream
  * Bumped version number from 6.12 to 6.26
  * Bumped version number from 6.26 to 6.30
  * Bumped Version number from 6.30 to 6.31 (github)
  * Bumped to 6.31/6.33
  * tagged as 6.33 release. Changed DH_COMPAT from 5 to 9
